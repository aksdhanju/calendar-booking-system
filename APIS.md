**Design Decisions/Assumptions/Information**

- I created 2 separate endpoints for create availability rules and update availability rules.
- Input validation is done at request DTO level using annotations provided by Jakarta Validation framework.
- Custom annotation class(@ValidAvailabilityRules) is created for specific validations. We cannot have any
field as null. We need start time and end time to be at full hour. We need start time to be before or equal to end time.
  No duplicate time slots are allowed.
- By default POST endpoint is not idempotent. If duplicate requests to create availability
rules come at same time, we use compare and swap approach(similar to optimistic locking)
and make sure we do not create 2 records in our data store(concurrent hash map in our case).
To implement above, computeIfAbsent method of ConcurrentHashMap is used.
- (How computeIfAbsent is working here) If the current value at hashmap's heap address is the expected value,
then it is replaced by the new value and return true. 
It means the last time we read this address and now, no other thread has modified this location.
If it is not the case, then it returns false. Means between last time we read
the expected value at this location and now, some other thread has modified this location.
So we do not modify this location and return false. This is real concurrency.
All this comparison is done in single, atomic assembly instruction.
During this time, we are sure that no other thread can interrupt our process.
This is essential for the CASing to work.
We can modify values at given location in memory without using synchronization tools.
- In case there is less thread contention, this approach is much more efficient than synchronization.
- Rules are stored per owner. Logic is added to method to merge overlapping slots/intervals. Ultimately when we save rules in data store,
we need them to be non overlapping. Though there can be more than 1 rule for a day.

## 2. (Availability Setup API) Update Availability Rules for an owner

**Endpoint**
```
PUT /api/v1/availability/setup
```

**Request Body Fields**
- Contains the new availability rules to be set/updated.

| Field               | Type        | Validation                                                                                                                            | Description                               |

| `rules`             | `List`      | Not null, max 30 rules, each validated individually                                                                                   | List of availability rules for this owner |
| `rules[].dayOfWeek` | `DayOfWeek` | Must be a valid Java `DayOfWeek` value (Possible values `MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`, `THURSDAY`, `FRIDAY`, `SATURDAY`, `SUNDAY`) | Day of the week the availability applies  |
| `rules[].startTime` | `LocalTime` | Must be in `HH:mm` format. Example 16:00. Valid values from 00:00 to 23:00                                                            | Starting time for the availability slot   |

    {
      "dayOfWeek": "MONDAY",
      "startTime": "16:00",
      "endTime": "23:00"
    },
    {
      "dayOfWeek": "TUESDAY",

      "startTime": "16:00",
      "endTime": "23:00"
    }
  ]
}'
```

**Design Decisions/Assumptions/Information**
- This endpoint is similar to  create availability rules endpoint. It is PUT endpoint and by definition it 
is expected to be idempotent which it is. 
- I am assuming we are fine with lost updates as a read pheonomenon in this method. If 2 threads come 
of same owner id and try to update availability rules, the second threads changes would be persisted in DB
ultimately.
- This endpoint supports both create and update availability rules with different response codes.
- All input validations and other logic is similar as described in create availability rules endpoint.
- I am assuming creating and updating availability rules is a 1 time thing. So there would be less 
possibility of high concurrency in this endpoint.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "No Available slots found for owner id: 1",
  "slots": []
}
```
- `200 OK` â†’ (Case 2)Available slots fetched successfully
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message":  "Available slots fetched successfully for owner id: 1",

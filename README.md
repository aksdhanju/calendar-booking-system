## Overview

This system enables Calendar Owners to define their availability, and Invitees to search and book 60-minute time slots without overlaps.

### Terminology

- **Calendar Owner**: A user who sets availability for bookings.
- **Invitee**: A user who books appointments with Calendar Owners.
- **Appointment**: A 60-minute booking made by an Invitee.

---

## Features

- Set up availability rules for each day of the week(configurable)
- Search available 60-minute time slots on a given day
- Book appointments from available slots
- Prevent double-booking
- View upcoming appointments for an owner

---

## Prerequisites
- Java 21 â†’ Ensure JAVA_HOME is set to Java 21.
- Gradle â†’ You can use the included Gradle wrapper (./gradlew) without installing Gradle globally.
- Git â†’ For cloning the repository.
- IDE (Optional) â†’ IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java support.
- No database setup is required.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aksdhanju/calendar-booking-system.git
cd calendar-booking-system
```

### 2. Storage
```bash
The application uses in-memory HashMaps for storing availability and appointment data.
No database setup is required.
Data will be lost when the application restarts.
```

### 3. Build the Application

```bash
./gradlew clean build --refresh-dependencies
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```
The application will start at:
```bash
http://localhost:8080
```
Note: To change port to new port(example 8081)
Do below change in application.yml
```bash
server.port: 8081
```

To kill current process running on port 8080
```bash
lsof -i:8080
kill -9 {process_id}
```

### 5. Access API Documentation

Once the server is running, access Swagger UI at:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/swagger-ui/index.html
```

## API Endpoints
Note: Please refer to [APIS.md](./APIS.md) file for endpoint specific details

---

## Assumptions
Note: Please refer to endpoint specific assumptions in [APIS.md](./APIS.md) file

- Users (owners/invitees) are already authenticated.
- No authentication or session management is implemented.
- In-memory data storage is used; persistence is not required.
- Appointments are always 60 minutes, and must start at the top of the hour. Though its configurable.

---

## Running Tests

Tests include unit coverage for:
- Availability slot generation
- Validation logic
- Appointment booking and conflict detection

Run following gradle command to run tests:
```bash
./gradlew test
```

## Design Decisions
Note: Please refer to endpoint specific design decisions in [APIS.md](./APIS.md) file

- Tried to incorporate SOLID principles, design patterns (Strategy Pattern) while creating classes and DTOs.
- Designed code to be **extensible** for future requirement changes.
- Followed **modular and maintainable** approach using layered architecture of a Spring Boot application (Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository).
- Used **Spring Boot** for REST API, dependency injection, and configuration management.
- Applied **Strategy Pattern** for time validation logic to support multiple booking strategies in the future.
- Used **DTOs and custom validators** for strict and clean request validation.
- Implemented **centralized exception handling** using `@ControllerAdvice` for consistent error responses.
- Adopted **OpenAPI/Swagger** for clear API documentation.
- Ensured **separation of concerns** between persistence logic, business logic, and presentation.
- Optimized for **concurrency safety** in appointment booking using optimistic locking.
- Incorporated **unit tests** and **integration tests** to validate functionality and prevent regressions.
- Structured project for **easy onboarding** â€” meaningful package structure, descriptive class names, and in-code comments.
- Chose **Java Time API** (`LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `DayOfWeek`) to avoid timezone pitfalls.
- Designed APIs to return **consistent response structure** (status, message, data) for both success and error scenarios.
- Ensured **scalability readiness** â€” services are stateless and can be deployed in multiple instances.
- Self explanatory debug,info,warn,error logs added at various places in the application
